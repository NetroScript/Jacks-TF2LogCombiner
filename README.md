# TF2 Log Combiner
_____________________________________________
Like the name implies - this is a script to Combine Logs on https://www.logs.tf 

It is a command line application and it will (unlike other Log Combiners) try to minimize the log a bit.
Meaning you can fit more maps into a log. (Or at least that's the aim)

### Notes:  

If there are any errors shown feel free to send them to me, so I can fix them.
I made this on windows, but should also work on Linux.

## Installation
_____________________________________________

* Download this as zip and extract it to the folder where you want it to be
* Get Python (3.X)
* Execute the file with `python main.py` (in the console with the folder where main.py resides as working directory - to simplify this just create a `run.bat` in the directory with the same content)
* Check if you get a module error (like: `ImportError: No module named '<module name>'`) if so then open a console (On Windows Win + R and type cmd and press enter) and type `python -m pip install <module name>`
* Enjoy
